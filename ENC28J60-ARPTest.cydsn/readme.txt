and prints the resolved MAC Address on the character LCD.

(For traffic capture data,see ARP_Traffic.txt in ENC28J60-ARPTest.cydsn folder)

Current status: 
-ENC28J60 Hardware Test Code Done.
-ARP Request/Reply Code Done.

This code has been tested with:
  Hardware: CY8CKIT-030 with ENC28J60 module from www.embeddedmarket.com
  Software: PSoC Creator 2.1 with cy_boot 3.0
